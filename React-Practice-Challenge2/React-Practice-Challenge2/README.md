# Challenge 2

set up a React app from scratch
Render an <App /> component
App should be in its own file
App should render 5 <Joke /> components
Each Joke should receive a "question" prop and a "punchLine" prop and render those however you'd like

### EXTRA CREDIT:
Some jokes are only a punch line with no question:
E.g.: "Itâ€™s hard to explain puns to kleptomaniacs because they always take things literally."
If you don't pass in a "question" prop, how might you make it only show the punchline instead?
Spend time practicing the style of your Joke component

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```
